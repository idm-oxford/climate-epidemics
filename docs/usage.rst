Installation

The required dependencies are only available through conda (or mamba). To use
climepi, download the source code. Working in the repository root directory,
create a conda virtual environment with the package and its required dependencies using
the provided environment.yml file:

.. code-block:: console

    climate-epidemics $ conda env create -f environment.yml

The virtual environment can be activated using the following command:   

.. code-block:: console
    
    climate-epidemics $ conda activate climepi
