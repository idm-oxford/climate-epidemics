climepi documentation
=====================

climepi is a Python package for combining climate projections with models of
climate suitability for vector-borne disease. It enables the future impacts of
climate change on disease risks to be analyzed, accounting for different sources
of uncertainty (uncertainty in emissions scenarios, structural uncertainty across 
climate models and internal climate variability).
